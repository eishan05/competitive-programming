Links to the problems can be found in readme files inside problem folders.

If you have a better solution, please feel free to send in a pull request. Although I only push solutions accepted by popular online judges (thereby, pass their test cases), if you think my code fails some test cases, please create an issue and specify the test cases that cause my code to fail.

Anyways, have fun solving problems!
