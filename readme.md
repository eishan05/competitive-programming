Links to the problems can be found in the readme file of every solution. Try the problems yourself first before consulting the solutions!

If you have a better solution, please feel free to send in a pull request. Although I only push solutions accepted by popular online judges, if you think my code fails some test cases, please create an issue and specify the test cases that cause my code to fail.

Anyways, have fun solving problems!
